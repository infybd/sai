Here are three professional user stories tailored for a Team Lead role, specifically aligned with the merged exception log dataset. These stories focus on Exception Summary, Trends Over Time, and Exception Type Analysis, keeping in mind the data inconsistencies and multi-source nature.

ðŸ”¹ User Story 1: Exception Summary Across Applications

As a Team Lead,
I want to view a high-level summary of total exceptions per application,
So that I can quickly identify which applications are experiencing the highest volume of issues and prioritize investigation or remediation.

Acceptance Criteria:

A visual (e.g., bar/column chart or KPI cards) showing the total number of exceptions per application (SMTP, MongoDB, SQL, ANN, CNN).

Indicators for data completeness (e.g., number of records per application or time coverage).

Tooltips or metadata showing how many records are missing key fields (e.g., timestamps, exception types).

ðŸ”¹ User Story 2: Exception Trends Over Time

As a Team Lead,
I want to analyze exception trends over time (by week or month),
So that I can detect spikes, drops, or patterns in error occurrence and take preventive measures or address ongoing issues.

Acceptance Criteria:

A line or area chart showing number of exceptions per time period.

Filters by application, exception type, or component.

Highlight periods with missing or sparse data (e.g., shaded areas or annotations).

Option to drill down (e.g., from month to week or day).

ðŸ”¹ User Story 3: Exception Type Analysis Across All Applications

As a Team Lead,
I want to see the distribution of exception types across all logs,
So that I can understand the most common failure modes and prioritize bug fixing or root cause analysis accordingly.

Acceptance Criteria:

A visual (e.g., pie chart or horizontal bar chart) showing top N exception types and their frequency.

Filters to analyze by application or time period.

Tooltip metadata or warnings where certain exception types are missing or inconsistently named across applications.

Grouping or normalization if similar exceptions have different labels across sources.
