User Stories â€“ SMTP Exception Log Analysis Project (End-to-End)

1. Data Collection Phase

Story 1:As a Data Analyst, I want to collect exception logs from the SMTP service of the e-commerce application, so I can analyze errors across different modules.

Story 2:As a Data Analyst, I want to collect exception data in JSON and XML  format with fields like exception type, class, timestamp, user, method, and IP, so that I can perform structured analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing & Transformation Phase

Story 3:As a Data Analyst, I want to flatten the nested JSON structure into tabular format, so that I can load it into Power BI easily.

Story 4:As a Data Analyst, I want to convert the date_time field into Date, Time, and Weekday columns, so that I can analyze exception trends over time.

Story 5:As a Data Analyst, I want to categorize exception types into broader categories (e.g., SMTP Error, Validation Error, Network Error), so stakeholders can focus on major problem areas.

Story 6:As a Data Analyst, I want to flag repeated IP addresses or domains, so suspicious or problematic sources can be identified.

Story 7:As a Data Analyst, I want to clean and validate all user_name, domain, and method_name values to ensure consistency before analysis.
3. Analysis & Visualization Phase

Story 8:As a Developer, I want to see a chart showing the number of exceptions by exception type, so I can focus on the most frequent error categories.
Story 9:As a Project Manager, I want a dashboard showing total exceptions per week, severity breakdown, and resolution trend, so I can assess release readiness.
