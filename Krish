Transformation and Power BI Preparation

Created a structured path to store all incoming datasets to ensure consistent data organization.

Collected datasets from various team members and renamed each file according to defined naming standards.

Saved all renamed datasets in the designated storage path for easy reference and automation compatibility.

Loaded each dataset into Power BI and standardized column names to follow a uniform naming convention across all files.

Updated the data types of columns in each dataset to match their intended data format, improving data quality and compatibility.

Ensured all datasets had consistent column names and types to facilitate accurate merging.

Merged all cleaned datasets into a single consolidated dataset for reporting and analysis.

Removed unnecessary or null-value columns from the merged dataset to improve clarity and performance.

Added additional calculated or reference columns that provide meaningful insights for visualization.

Final merged dataset was used as the base table for Power BI visualizations and dashboard reporting.
