Got it â€” you have 5 application exception logs with:

Different time periods (non-aligned time ranges)

Unequal number of records (some logs have 5k entries, others 1k-2k)

Mostly overlapping but not exactly the same columns

Data inconsistencies or missing fields across logs


Given this, the user stories must reflect the realities of merged, somewhat heterogeneous and biased data, while still enabling actionable insights for the project team lead.

Tailored User Stories Considering Data Variability and Bias


---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 1: High-Level Exception Summary with Data Quality Awareness

As a project team lead,
I want to see a high-level summary of total exceptions per application and per time period,
so that I can understand exception volumes while being aware of differing data coverage and volume biases.

Include data completeness indicators (e.g., total records per source, time coverage ranges).

Visualize exception counts normalized by data volume if possible.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 2: Time Period Comparison with Gaps Highlighted

As a project team lead,
I want to see exception trends over time with clear indication of missing or sparse data periods for each application log,
so that I can interpret trends accurately, knowing where data gaps may affect analysis.

Highlight time ranges with no or low data to avoid misleading conclusions.

Allow filtering or separate views per log source to compare apples to apples.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 3: Cross-Application Exception Type Aggregation with Variance Notice

As a project team lead,
I want to view exception type distributions aggregated across all logs,
but with alerts or notes when exception types are missing or differently named across logs,
so that I can trust the aggregated insights or drill down when needed.

Implement exception type mapping or normalization where possible.

Provide metadata showing which logs contribute to each exception type.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 4: Component and Method Exception Impact by Source

As a project team lead,
I want to analyze exceptions by application components and methods, grouped by log source,
so that I can prioritize critical components in each application while understanding data source differences.

Provide comparison views: component-wise exception counts per log source.

Use filters to view individual application logs or merged data.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 5: User Impact Analysis with Data Completeness Caveat

As a project team lead,
I want to identify users most affected by exceptions across logs,
but be informed about possible missing user info or inconsistent identifiers in some logs,
so that I can take action on high-impact cases while considering data limitations.

Show which logs have reliable user data.

Flag missing or inconsistent user info.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 6: Exception Severity and Criticality Insights

As a project team lead,
I want to classify exceptions by severity or criticality if available, aggregated across logs,
so that I can focus on high-priority issues even if logs have varying levels of detail.

Provide filters or categories for severity if data exists.

Include notes on logs missing severity information.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 7: Data Source Contribution and Bias Transparency

As a project team lead,
I want to understand the contribution of each log source to the overall dataset,
so that I can interpret analysis results with awareness of data volume bias.

Dashboard section showing counts, coverage period, and column completeness per log source.

Visual markers for data skew and coverage.



---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 8: Filterable Exception Analysis by Source, Time, and Component

As a project team lead,
I want to filter and slice exception data by source, time range, component, exception type, and user,
so that I can perform granular root cause analysis despite the heterogeneous data.


---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 9: Alerts on Data Anomalies and Missing Data

As a project team lead,
I want to receive alerts or visual indicators when the merged dataset shows anomalies such as sudden drops in exceptions or missing critical columns,
so that I can investigate potential data collection or integration issues.


---

ðŸ”¹ User Story 10: Continuous Data Quality Improvement Feedback Loop

As a project team lead,
I want feedback on which logs or fields have the most missing or inconsistent data,
so that I can coordinate with teams to improve logging standards and data quality over time.

If you want, I can help you write a detailed Power BI implementation plan or prepare data normalization scripts next, or draft specific user stories in Agile format with acceptance criteria.

Would you like me to proceed with any of these?
