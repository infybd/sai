Great â€” since you've provided all 5 exception logs (SMTP, SQL, MongoDB, ANN, CNN), and you're creating a Power BI dashboard from the merged data, here is a detailed list of user stories specifically for a Project Team Lead to guide and justify dashboard requirements from the merged exception log dataset.


---

âœ… Context of the Merged Dashboard

You're merging all 5 logs into one dataset with common fields like:

application_name

application_component

method_name

exception_type

exception_class

exception_description

date_time

user_id

user_name

domain

ip_address

log_source (SMTP, SQL, MongoDB, ANN, CNN)

ðŸ“Œ Goal

The Project Team Lead needs a centralized dashboard that gives real-time insights into exception trends, affected modules/users, and critical error areas for better planning, issue prioritization, and communication with developers and QA.

### ðŸ”¹User Story 1: Cross-Application Exception Volume Overview

As a project team lead,
I want to see a summary of exception counts grouped by application name and log source (SMTP, SQL, MongoDB, ANN, CNN),
so that I can identify which applications are most prone to errors and where to focus efforts.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Stacked bar chart of exception_count by application_name and log_source


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 2: Time-Based Exception Trend

As a project team lead,
I want to visualize exception trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly),
so that I can detect peak error periods and investigate what went wrong during those times.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Line graph of exception_count over date_time


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 3: Most Affected Components

As a project team lead,
I want to identify the top components or modules (application_component) causing the most exceptions,
so that I can allocate developer efforts for improvement in those areas.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Bar chart of exception_count by application_component


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 4: Exception Type Distribution

As a project team lead,
I want to understand the distribution of different exception types,
so that I can prioritize handling critical types like database failures over minor user input errors.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Pie chart or donut chart of exception_type


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 5: Top Users Affected by Exceptions

As a project team lead,
I want to see the users (user_id or user_name) most affected by recurring exceptions,
so that we can escalate high-impact cases and improve user experience.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Table or bar chart of user_name vs exception_count


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 6: Exception Hotspots by Domain

As a project team lead,
I want to view the exception count grouped by domain (if it represents business units or customer environments),
so that I can determine if any particular domain is experiencing instability.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Heatmap or column chart of domain vs exception_count


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 7: Real-Time Exception Feed

As a project team lead,
I want a real-time or most recent list of exceptions with details,
so that I can monitor ongoing issues and take timely decisions.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Table sorted by date_time DESC, showing application_name, exception_type, user_name, component


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 8: Exceptions by Log Source (Comparison View)

As a project team lead,
I want to compare exceptions from different sources like SMTP, SQL, etc.,
so that I know whether backend, model, or third-party services are responsible for instability.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Clustered bar chart or multi-series line graph comparing log sources


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 9: Filterable Dashboard for Root Cause Analysis

As a project team lead,
I want to filter the dashboard by application_name, log_source, exception_type, and user_name,
so that I can drill down to specific scenarios during root cause analysis.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: Slicers or filters for dimensions like app name, exception type, user, and date


---

ðŸ”¹User Story 10: SLA Compliance Tracker (Optional if resolution timestamps available)

As a project team lead,
I want to track the average time taken to resolve exceptions (if available),
so that I can ensure issues are resolved within our defined SLAs.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Element: KPI card or line chart (requires extra data like resolved_time)

ðŸ›  How to Use in Power BI

To implement these stories:

1. Prepare a single merged table in Power BI (using Power Query) with a log_source column.


2. Create a data model (star schema if needed) with dimensions: time, user, application, etc.


3. Use visuals mentioned above for each user story.


4. Create bookmarks or report pages for views tailored to Project Lead, Developer, QA.

Would you like me to generate a sample Power BI layout mockup or write SQL/Power Query code to prepare the merged dataset?
